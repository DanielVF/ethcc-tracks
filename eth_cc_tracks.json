Where we at? Where we want to be?","Abstract":"We'll cover the current trend of sequencing, which encompasses various approaches such as centralized, decentralized, and shared sequencing services. The increasing complexity of this field, coupled with the presence of various options and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value), has made it challenging to navigate. We aim to provide an overview of the existing landscape and offer insights into future developments in sequencing.","Track":"Rollups & other chains","Day":"Wednesday","Category":"Talk","Date":"Day 3: July 19th","Website Date":"2023-07-19","Room":"Main Stage","Starting Hour":"11:50:00","Time":"15","Ending hour":"12:05:00"},{"_rowNumber":335,"_rawData":["Martin Triay","OpenZeppelin","Yes","Account Abstraction in Starknet","Understand what Account Abstraction is and how does it look today in Starknet","Rollups & other chains","Wednesday","Talk","Day 3: July 19th","2023-07-19","Notre Dame Stage","14:50:00","15","15:05:00"],"speakers":"Martin Triay","Organisation":"OpenZeppelin","Selected":"Yes","Title":"Account Abstraction in Starknet","Abstract":"Understand what Account Abstraction is and how does it look today in Starknet","Track":"Rollups & other chains","Day":"Wednesday","Category":"Talk","Date":"Day 3: July 19th","Website Date":"2023-07-19","Room":"Notre Dame Stage","Starting Hour":"14:50:00","Time":"15","Ending hour":"15:05:00"},{"_rowNumber":336,"_rawData":["Ignasi Ramos","Polygon","Yes","zkEVM audit: Soundness & Completeness","1- Brief explanation of Soundness and completeness, and the difference\n2- Brief explanation of the zkEVM\n3- Soundness and completeness applied to the zkEVM\n4- Examples of soundness and completeness vulnerabilities at the zkEVM","Security","Monday","Talk","Day 1: July 17th","2023-07-17","Eiffel Stage","16:25:00","15","16:40:00"],"speakers":"Ignasi Ramos","Organisation":"Polygon","Selected":"Yes","Title":"zkEVM audit: Soundness & Completeness","Abstract":"1- Brief explanation of Soundness and completeness, and the difference\n2- Brief explanation of the zkEVM\n3- Soundness and completeness applied to the zkEVM\n4- Examples of soundness and completeness vulnerabilities at the zkEVM","Track":"Security","Day":"Monday","Category":"Talk","Date":"Day 1: July 17th","Website Date":"2023-07-17","Room":"Eiffel Stage","Starting Hour":"16:25:00","Time":"15","Ending hour":"16:40:00"},{"_rowNumber":340,"_rawData":["James Smith","Ethereum Foundation","Yes","Decentralizing the staking ecosystem","The problems and potential solutions to improve staking diversity (Geographically and protocols)","Blockchain economics","Monday","Talk","Day 1: July 17th","2023-07-17","Saint Victor","14:45:00","15","15:00:00"],"speakers":"James Smith","Organisation":"Ethereum Foundation","Selected":"Yes","Title":"Decentralizing the staking ecosystem","Abstract":"The problems and potential solutions to improve staking diversity (Geographically and protocols)","Track":"Blockchain economics","Day":"Monday","Category":"Talk","Date":"Day 1: July 17th","Website Date":"2023-07-17","Room":"Saint Victor","Starting Hour":"14:45:00","Time":"15","Ending hour":"15:00:00"},{"_rowNumber":341,"_rawData":["Charlotte Eli","Atlendis Labs","Yes","Enabling a rate discovery on-chain?","With undercollateralized lending comes the need to set a borrowing rate that properly represents the level of credit risk.
